# ALL-Project-bounty hunter

##Introduction
we are "ALL-Project" group, and this would be our second project for the first year of coventry university, studying computer science. we have been given a task/criteria to make bounty hunter game.
so our built game is :
-Items would be placed around the map randomly. meaning that every time the game starts it will mostly not be in the same place again.
(i.e. sports, clothes, food items would be placed around the map.)
-one robot which will operate by itself by using the pathfounding algorithm and the user is also able to move the robot with key down events.
-the user will gain points everytime the robot has collected the items thats from the shopping list for the robot to collect.
-at the end of the game the price of the items will be calculated to see if the robot has collected the cheapest items or the expensive items.
- the map and also other images, are added into the game as a background also with other features as well.

##the project uses:
-Object-oriented programming 
-sudo code
-pygame
-tkinter
-bubble sort(sorting algorithm)
-linear search(searching algorithm)
-the A* pathfounding algorithm

##the aim:
-making the game work 
-ease of use 
-enjoyable
-addictive 

##how to play
-download file 
-run game
-press play
-navigate robot
-restart
